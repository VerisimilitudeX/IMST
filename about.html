                <h2>The Founding of IMST</h2>
                <p>The International Mathematics Symposium Tournament (IMST) was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate mathematicians and educators who wanted to create a unique platform that combines humor, creativity, and mathematical problem-solving. Their vision was to break away from traditional math competitions and introduce an innovative tournament that would challenge participants while bringing joy and amusement to the world of mathematics.</p>
                <p>The founders believed that mathematics, often seen as serious and intimidating, could be made more accessible and enjoyable through a lighthearted approach. Thus, the IMST was born as a troll math tournament, where the problems are deliberately designed to be impossible or absurd, providing a refreshing twist to conventional math challenges.</p>

The IMST continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of math competitions, celebrating the beauty of mathematics in its most playful form.</p>
                <h2>Join the IMST Community</h2>
