# International Mathematics Symposium Tournament (IMST)

Welcome to the IMST, the most prestigious and hilarious math tournament in the world! ðŸŒŽ

The IMST is a troll math tournament with troll problems as a joke. It is designed to challenge and entertain math enthusiasts of all levels, from beginners to experts. The IMST is not affiliated with any official organization or institution, and is purely for fun and education.

## How it works
The IMST consists of one round:

Troll round: A 10-question multiple choice test that covers all kinds of math topics, from basic to advanced, but with a twist: every problem is a troll problem that is impossible or absurd to solve. You have 20 minutes to complete this round. The person who can provide the most valid solutions or convincing arguments will win the ultimate prize: a trip to the International Mathematics Symposium (IMS), where you can meet and troll with the worldâ€™s best mathematicians.
How to participate
To participate in the IMST, you need to register on our website. There is no fee to join the IMST, because we are generous and we love math. You can register as an individual or as a team of up to four people. You can also choose your preferred language and time zone for taking the test.

Once you register, you will receive an email with a link to access the online platform where you can take the test. You will also receive a confirmation code that you need to enter before starting the round. You can use any device and browser to access the platform, but we recommend using a laptop or desktop computer with a stable internet connection.

You can take the test anytime during the scheduled date for the round. You can only take the test once, and you cannot pause or resume the test once you start it. You can use any resources you want during the test, such as books, calculators, or online tools, but you cannot communicate with other participants or use any form of cheating.

## How to prepare
The IMST is not meant to be easy or boring. It is meant to be fun and challenging. Therefore, we do not provide any official study materials or guides for the IMST. However, we do provide some sample troll problems and solutions on our website, so you can get an idea of what to expect.

We also encourage you to explore various math topics on your own, using books, websites, videos, podcasts, or any other sources that interest you. You can also join our online community on Discord, where you can chat with other participants, ask questions, share tips, and exchange jokes.

## How to contribute
The IMST is a community-driven project that relies on the contributions of volunteers who love math and humor. If you want to contribute to the IMST in any way, such as writing troll problems, grading solutions, designing graphics, managing social media, or sponsoring prizes, please contact us at imst@gmail.com. We appreciate any help and feedback that can make the IMST better and more enjoyable for everyone.
