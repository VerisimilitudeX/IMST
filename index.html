                <h2>About the IMST</h2>
                <p>The IMST is a troll math tournament with troll problems as a joke. It is designed to challenge and
                    entertain math enthusiasts of all levels, from beginners to experts. The IMST is not affiliated with
                    any official organization or institution, and is purely for fun and education.</p>
                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p>The IMST consists of one round:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Troll round: A 10-question multiple choice test that covers all kinds of math topics, from basic
                        to advanced, but with a twist: every problem is a troll problem that is impossible or absurd to
                        solve. You have 20 minutes to complete this round.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The person who can provide the most valid solutions or convincing arguments will win the ultimate
                    prize: a trip to the International Mathematics Symposium (IMS), where you can meet and troll with
                    the worldâ€™s best mathematicians.</p>
                <h2>How to participate</h2>
                <p>To participate in the IMST, you need to register on our website. There is no fee to join the IMST,
                    because we are generous and we love math. You can register as an individual or as a team of up to
                    four people. You can also choose your preferred language and time zone for taking the test. Once you
                    register, you will receive an email with a link to access the online platform where you can take the
                    test. You will also receive a confirmation code that you need to enter before starting the round.
                    You can use any device and browser to access the platform, but we recommend using a laptop or
                    desktop computer with a stable internet connection. You can take the test anytime during the
                    scheduled date for the round. You can only take the test once, and you cannot pause or resume the
                    test once you start it. You can use any resources you want during the test, such as books,
                    calculators, or online tools, but you cannot communicate with other participants or use any form of
                    cheating.</p>
                <h2>How to prepare</h2>
                <p>The IMST is not meant to be easy or boring. It is meant to be fun and challenging. Therefore, we do
                    not provide any official study materials or guides for the IMST. However, we do provide some sample
                    troll problems and solutions on our website, so you can get an idea of what to expect. We also
                    encourage you to explore various math topics on your own, using books, websites, videos, podcasts,
                    or any other sources that interest you. You can also join our online community on Discord, where you
                    can chat with other participants, ask questions, share tips, and exchange jokes.</p>
                <h2>How to contribute</h2>
                <p>The IMST is a community-driven project that relies on the contributions of volunteers who love math
                    and humor. If you want to contribute to the IMST in any way, such as writing troll problems, grading
                    solutions, designing graphics, managing social media, or sponsoring prizes, please contact us at
                    imst@gmail.com. We appreciate any help and feedback that can make the IMST better and more enjoyable
                    for everyone.</p>
